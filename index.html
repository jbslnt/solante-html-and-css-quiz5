                I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
                Funny when you want it, suddenly you have it
                You find out that your gold's just plastic
                Every day, every night
                I've been thinkin' back on you and I
                Every day, every night
                I worked my whole life
                Just to get right, just to be like

                (You're runnin' out of time)
                My world's been hectic, seems electric
                But I've been waking up with your voice in my head
                And I'm tryna send a message and let you know that
                Every single minute I'm without you, I regret it

                "Look at me, I'm never coming down"
                I worked my whole life
                Just to get high, just to realize
                Everything I need is on the
                Everything I need is on the ground
                On the ground
                Everything I need is on the ground
                (Nah, but they don't hear me though)
                (Yeah, what goes up must come down)
                (Nah, but they don't hear me though)
                (You're runnin' out of time)
                I'm way up in the clouds
                And they say I've made it now
                But I figured it out
                Everything I need is on the ground (yeah, yeah)
                Just drove by your house (just drove by your house)
                So far from you now (so far from you now)
                But I figured it out
                Everything I need is on the
                Everything I need is on the ground
                On the ground
                Everything I need is on the ground
                (Nah, but they don't hear me though)
                On the ground
                (Nah, but they don't hear me though)
